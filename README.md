# Electronic Detective

## Overview

This is a re-creation of the 1979 Ideal Toy Corporation game, Electronic Detective. With updates. This game does more than just show LED readouts that have to be manually translated into clues on a paper sheet. There are the same 20 characters, six locations, two weapons and rules as in the original game. One character will become a murderer, and another...well...that's how these things go.

Rules:
* Only one murderer
* Only one victim
* One two four players
* The murderer will never be where a weapon has been dumped
* No clues will ever be found at the crime scene (nobody said these rules made complete sense)
* Everybody answers questions honestly, even the murderer, with one exception
* Only a suspect of the same gender as the killer is guaranteed to tell the truth about the fingerprints on the murder weapon (really, nobody said these rules made complete sense)
* If you guess wrong about the murderer, you're out
* First person to correctly identify the murderer wins
* Everyone gets to know what a suspect says in their initial statement. Questioning a suspect is private.

This is not a connected game. Multi-player happens all on one device. Pass around your phone, tablet, or mouse and engage with real people in the real world over a game while you harass each other.
